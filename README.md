* 50,000 retirement eligible employees of the 300,000 employees are Senior level employees
* There are only 1500 eligible employees to be mentors
## Summary
The silver tsunami is fast approaching and a little under 50% of the workforce will need to be replaced. As of now there are not enough employees that could mentor unless they each have about 100 trainees. There shoud be a mentorship program created so this level of departure isn't met with a lack of properly trained replacements. We can do this by filtering the employees who are 1-2 years away from retirement. Or possibly find employees who have retired in the prior year and bring them in as consultants to train a new work force if they are capable.
